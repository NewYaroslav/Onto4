# On Distinction and the Liar Paradox

## Introduction

The liar paradox is a well-known logical difficulty encapsulated in the short statement:

> "This statement is a lie."

Trying to determine the truth of such a claim sends us into a loop: if it is false, then it is true; if it is true, then it is false. This self-reference disrupts classical logic. Here we examine the liar paradox from an ontological and informational perspective—through the notion of **distinction**.

## Distinction as a condition of a logical state

> Any logical state (true or false) is possible only at the moment of distinguishing two different objects during comparison.

This is the basic principle. For a statement to be true or false, there must be a **difference**—a logical evaluation is impossible if there is nothing to distinguish.

Comparing one object with another makes logical evaluation possible. However, comparing an object **with itself** is not logically meaningful within the system—it requires an **external observer**.

The external observer is not someone real but an abstract distinction, an idea of distinction that lies outside the system.
Such an observer can compare an object inside the system with one outside the system or even objects from different systems.
For example, when we compare a body's position over time, we must relate two different moments.
Therefore the observer does not operate inside the system and cannot work with the system directly. It compares abstracted objects associated with systems and may even relate them to ideas belonging to no system at all.

## The role of the observer and the limits of distinction

> Comparing an object with itself is possible only if there is an external "observer"; within the system such comparison is impossible. Even then the "observer" compares a copy with the original or two copies of the original object.

Thus even when we say "a = a" we are not literally comparing the object with itself but performing an act by an observer who sees **two representations** of the same object. Without an external vantage point there is no sense in speaking about a logical operation of comparison.

In this sense the **observer is already a mechanism of distinction**. But once we abstract the observer and turn it into a universal logical tool, the **illusion** arises that it can be directed at itself—and **self-reference** appears.

Self-reference is possible because the "observer" is not the distinction itself but yet another **object** we manipulate inside the system.
If genuine distinction is a condition of being, the "observer" we use in reasoning is actually a **representation**, an **idea** that can be treated as an object.
This makes the step of self-reference possible: we address not the distinction itself but its image—as an argument, as an element of a logical construction.
Such an "observer" becomes an **operator** capable of taking anything as input, including itself.
This flexibility is useful for building abstractions but simultaneously creates the **possibility of logical paradoxes**.

## Informational perspective

> In information theory at least two states are required for information to be encoded. You need two DIFFERENT states.

Even one bit of information requires at least two logically distinct states: "0" and "1".

> If we take a comparison object by itself that must be a logical state, then inevitably, for information to exist, there must be a second state, at least hypothetically.

This is the key point: **information is impossible without distinction**. A single state without another has no meaning. Even if we fix the value "1", we do so **in contrast to** the possible "0".

> Thus even 1 bit of information is already a comparison of objects (states).

This makes impossible a situation in which an object by itself carries information without implying another possible state.

## Self-reference as a consequence of abstracting the observer

> Another important point is that self-reference arises because of the concept of the observer.

Once the observer is considered **outside** distinction, as a universal operator, there emerges the possibility of directing distinction at itself. This leads to the idea of a statement asserting something about **its own truth**.

> The concept of the observer takes "distinction" outside the system, turning it into an abstract instrument; the boundaries of the applicability of distinction therefore become unclear.

This blurs the borders: we begin applying logical constructions where the conditions for them are **ontologically impossible**.

> In fact we would not even know about the limits of distinction because such things simply would not happen. The idea of limits on the applicability of distinction appears only relative to the idea of an observer who tries to abstract even from distinction itself.

Thus **only at the moment of breakdown**—as in the liar paradox—do we first **notice the boundary of the applicability of logic**. The paradox becomes a window onto the limits of thought.

## Conclusion

The liar paradox is not merely a logical anomaly. It points out that applying logical categories requires a prior condition: the **presence of distinction**, the actual presence of at least two ontologically distinguishable states.

It is important to emphasize that **distinction does not require an observer**. It can occur within the system as its internal dynamics. However, the **concept of an observer** is an abstraction that arises when distinction is reflected upon and separated as an idea. It is not the distinction itself but a **concept of the distinguisher**.

Self-reference is the result of this abstraction, when the observer tries to distinguish itself as an object. The liar paradox follows from precisely this operation: logical distinction is applied where it is ontologically impossible.

Thus the liar paradox is a grammatically admissible but **ontologically meaningless** construction. It marks the boundary beyond which **not only logic but information loses applicability**.
